# spam-name-password-generator
Generate passwords using names from The Spambank.

This idea was given to me by Paul Herber. Credit to you!

From about 2005 to 2007, my inbox was deluged with spam that had randomly generated names in the from field. The names made me laugh out loud and I started keeping a record of them in a spreadsheet. This grew into the creation of The Spambank, where I added the names to a PM Wiki as they came in. 

The spam eventually stopped, and I stopped updating the PM Wiki. Over the years I occasionally remember The Spambank, or someone or something reminds me of it, and indeed just the other day, I was trying to come up with a password for something and thought, "What is the most random and nonsensical pair of words I can come up with?" And sure enough, a name from the spambank, plus a number and a special character became my new password.

Paul suggested it would be a great idea to create a password generator based on the contents of The Spambank, and I think I will take up the challenge when I'm ready.

I read the contents this morning and it still made me chuckle out loud and snigger quite a bit.

Thinking about it, I'd love to see the code that was generating those names all those years ago. Pretty rudimentary, I'd imagine.
